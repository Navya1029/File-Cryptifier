# File-Cryptor

This is a Team-Based Project for an Object Oriented Design Course at CSU.
The purpose of this project is to have at least two Design Patterns. We are using Strategy and Model-View-Controller as our two Design Patterns. This
program will allow any user to encrypt and decrypt any message using either
Symmetric Key Cryptography or Asymmetric Key Cryptography.
