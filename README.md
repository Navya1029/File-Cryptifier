# File-Cryptor

This is a Team-Based Project for an Object Oriented Design Course at CSU.
The purpose of this project is to have at least two Design Patterns. We are using Strategy and Model-View-Controller as our two Design Patterns. This
program will allow any user to encrypt and decrypt any message using either
Symmetric Key Cryptography or Asymmetric Key Cryptography.

## Encrypting & Decrypting With Asymmetric Key:
For this, select the Asymmetric radio button and select the file you want to use. Next either generate keys or select the keys you would like to use. Generating keys selects them for you so you don't have to.
